### warning
#### call setState before mount
在挂载之前调用了setState，以更新状态

eventsource.js:2178 Warning: Can't call setState on a component that is not yet mounted. This is a no-op, but it might indicate a bug in your application. Instead, assign to `this.state` directly or define a `state = {};` class property with the desired state in the BlogList component
